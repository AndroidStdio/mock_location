MockLocation
=============

MockLocation, a [SocialGoodworking][1] project, is an Android application that can be used to set fake GPS locations returned by the GPS provider for testing purposes, 
letting you record routes and play them back.

It uses ActionBarSherlock, Google Maps Android API v2 and a location library written by me.

MockLocation also demonstrates a first pass at an approach that tries to answer this question:

'How can I quickly see, understand and negotiate what I’ll be giving up when I click ‘I accept the Terms of Service’ 
on a website or mobile application?'

See http://mappingthegaps.blogspot.com/2012/09/data-practice-policy-and-negotiated-use_2811.html for details.

MockLocation works 'out-of-box' with most loaction apps. Just start MockLocation before starting the app. I've found one exception
to this: if you want to send mock locations to Google's Navigation app, you'll have to turn on the GPS chip before starting MockLocation.
